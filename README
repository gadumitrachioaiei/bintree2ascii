This module implements drawing an ascii representation of a binary tree, useful especially for bst trees, as you can clearly see the left and right subtrees.

It offers three ways to generate the ascii art:
1. Your tree implements the Interface interface.
2. You can serialize your tree as json following certain naming conventions.
3. You can give a graphviz dot representation of your tree.

These are explained well in the documentation.
